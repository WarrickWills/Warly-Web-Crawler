# Warly-Web-Crawler

Welcome to the War-ly WebCrawler. <br  />

## These are some of the functionalities we offer with our search tool.

- At the “Please enter URL of desired site:” query, you can enter any webpage URL you want to query. 
 
- At the “Please enter the keyword:” query, you can enter the keyword that is used to filter links that contain that Meta keyword.
 
- At the “Please enter minimum image count sought for links:” query, you can enter the limit of the amount of images in a URL. 
 
- If you do not enter an integer, the program will tell you that it is an invalid image count and ask you to enter the image count again.
 
- At the “Please enter depth of crawl:” query, you can enter the depth at which you wish the web crawler to iterate to.
 
- After entering these parameters the results should show.

- After it is finished you will be asked to enter another search or exit the program. <br  />
  If after entering all of these values there are no results found, you will be asked to enter another search or exit the program.
